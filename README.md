# P06-Extended-Mod
<p><b>P-06: eXtended</b> is a mod (made by me, aka 4ndrelus) for <b>Sonic P-06</b> (a game developed by ChaosX). <br/>
This repo contains new files, and fragments of the original files, containing extra content added or changed by the mod. 
Basically, every class, function and variable with <i>"X"</i> or <i>"X_"</i> prefix has been created and added to the game. </p>

<foot>The modding process requires decompiling the C# Assembly, making changes and recompiling it, <br/>so the code may have some visible side effects, like redundant <code>this</code> and <code>base</code> keywords.</foot>
